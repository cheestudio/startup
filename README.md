### Compile .SCSS & .JS

**Note:** Both NodeJS and NPM are required to be installed in order to run the commands below.

1. In root of the theme folder, run `npm install` to install needed packages to run gulp

2. Once packages are installed, run `gulp`

3. .SCSS files will compile to `style.css` and `style.min.css` (only the minified version is used)

4. .JS source will compile to `all.min.js`

5. File watching is enabled as long as gulp is running
